## Project Title

hellocomputing test BackEnd APP

## Description

Our goal is to make math engaging and fun by providing an interactive application that allows children to visualize figures and learn how to calculate their perimeters and areas easily. Our web application allows the user to choose from a list of shapes including rectangle, square, circle, and triangle. Once a shape is selected, the user can choose whether they want to know the perimeter or area of that shape. They can then enter the required values and the application will calculate the perimeter or area of the selected shape.

But that's not all! Our application also allows the user to convert the calculated perimeter or area into other units such as centimetre, decimetre, metre and kilometre. The default unit is metre (m), but the user can switch to any unit from the list provided. The list of possible units and shapes are retrieved directly from our Node.js API that is specifically built for this purpose.
